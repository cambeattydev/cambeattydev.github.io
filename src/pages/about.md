### Beginning Years
To be honest, I was not one of those people that grew up writing code when they were younger or had a special computer that I remember the name of. I found my enjoyment for code when I was in college, where I originally went to get a math degree. My original plan was to go into engineering, but the college I went to did not have that as a path. Maybe more on that in a seperate post. While in college, I took a computer class as a required elective. I quickly realized I was spending most of my limited free time trying to make my computer science homework even better. After completing that course, I changed my major to computer science and didn't turn back. In college most of our classes were taught using Java, others used different languages where appropriate. I was able to secure a job before graduating college (which was a much needed relief), but that position was for a .Net software developer.



### Professional
Starting out my professional career by learning a new language, SDLC, agile, etc. was difficult, but thankfully my company was gracious and allowed me the time and space to learn and make mistakes. I hope that at some point I can be on the other side of the exchange. This job and my next was all about writing code, in both positions I worked in the .Net stack writing C# and working with SQL databases. For the most part, I have stayed with the Microsoft world and have quite enjoyed it. In my more recent roles, I started branching out from both .Net and software development.In my current role, I pick the tool that makes the most sense for the job. If that means using python to do something quick and dirty, or using typescript for a full stack app as that means the entire team can do both front and backend work. I have moved to more of an architect role, but still do get my hands dirty.


### Moving forward
As mentioned above, I am working on expanding outside of the microsoft stack. It has changed a lot in the last few years, one I personally think has been great. I’m sure I will continue to use it as I think C# and F# are great languages. Learning is a constant in life and especially in the technology field. I don’t want to speculate on what to expect from my projects and decisions I will make on what to use, buy I hope expand my knowledge and hope to share all that learning with you
